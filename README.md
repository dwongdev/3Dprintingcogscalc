So basically I kept a google sheet with some formulas to help me consider pricing for 3D prints. Every now and then I re-made it a little tidier but this time I figured I'd just feed the info to an LLM and have it make it on a page. I figured it could be useful for others so here we are.

I'll record a video going over why some of the fields are included and what they mean (PPH - profit per [print] hour for example).
